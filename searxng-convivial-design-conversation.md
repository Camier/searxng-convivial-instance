# Searxng Convivial Instance Design Conversation

## Date: January 6, 2025

This conversation documents the complete design of a convivial Searxng instance for 2-3 friends, emphasizing shared discovery and intellectual companionship over corporate productivity tools.

## Initial Request

**User**: which feature could we think of a searxng instance i'd share with friends for:
1) academic research (sciences, botany, ethnopharmacology AND ALSO academic history researches)
2) music digging, finding, sharing

## Design Process

### Phase 1: Core Features Brainstorming

The design evolved through multiple iterations, covering:

1. **Academic Research Features**
   - Specialized engines for sciences, botany, ethnopharmacology
   - French historical archives focus
   - Advanced filtering and metadata extraction
   - Collaborative bibliographies

2. **Music Discovery Features**
   - Independent platforms (no Spotify)
   - Bandcamp, SoundCloud, Free Music Archive focus
   - Genre filtering and BPM detection
   - Shared playlists and discovery feeds

3. **Collaborative Features**
   - Morning coffee discoveries
   - Synchronous dig sessions
   - Voice notes and annotations
   - Gift discoveries

### Phase 2: French Historical Enhancement

Special emphasis on French archives:
- Gallica BnF (8M+ documents)
- Archives Nationales
- RetroNews (1631-1950)
- All 101 departmental archives
- Medieval manuscripts (Biblissima)
- Revolutionary archives

### Phase 3: Convivial Philosophy

The instance was reimagined as a "digital salon" for 2-3 friends:

**Key Principles**:
- Joy over productivity
- Serendipity over efficiency
- Ambient awareness, not surveillance
- Trust-based privacy

**Signature Features**:
- ☕ Morning coffee reactions
- 🌙 Search moods (late night rabbit hole, botanical Sunday)
- 🎁 Gift discoveries
- 🎤 Voice postcards
- ✨ Collision moments

### Phase 4: Technical Architecture

**Infrastructure**:
- 4GB VPS, Docker Compose
- Redis for real-time features
- PostgreSQL for collections
- WebSocket for presence
- ~$5-10/person/month

**Plugin System**:
- convivial_presence.py
- discovery_feed.py
- voice_notes.py
- search_moods.py
- time_capsule.py

### Phase 5: GitHub Research

Explored existing Searxng projects for inspiration:
- Theme systems (Catppuccin, seasonal)
- Redis integration patterns
- WebSocket implementations
- Music player integrations

## Memory Migration Journey

### The Challenge
- Initial storage in Memento knowledge graph
- Mixed with thesis content
- Need for separation

### The Solution
- Migrated to Memory Bank MCP
- Created dedicated project file
- Deleted 13 entities from Memento:
  1. Searxng Collaborative Instance Design
  2. Convivial Search Features
  3. Academic Research Engines
  4. Music Discovery Engines
  5. Ambient Awareness Design
  6. Collection Personality Types
  7. Implementation Roadmap
  8. GitHub Brainstorming Discoveries
  9. Theme Enhancement Ideas
  10. Technical Integration Opportunities
  11. Music Integration Architecture
  12. Advanced Collaborative Features
  13. Plugin Concepts

### Final Storage
- Complete project now in: `searxng-convivial-project.md` in Memory Bank
- Thesis work remains clean in Memento
- True separation achieved

3. **Phase 3**: Deep comfort (Month 2)
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features (Month 3)

## Project Philosophy

This isn't just a search engine - it's a space for:
- Intellectual companionship
- Shared discovery journeys
- Ambient awareness of friends' interests
- Celebrating serendipitous connections
- Creating a warm, digital salon

The design prioritizes human connection and joy of discovery over efficiency and productivity metrics.
