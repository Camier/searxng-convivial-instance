### Backup and Recovery

**Backup Strategy:**

**Database Backups:**
- Full backup: Daily at 2:00 AM CET
- Incremental backup: Every 6 hours
- Point-in-time recovery logs: Continuous
- Retention: 30 days online, 1 year archive

**File System Backups:**

- User-uploaded content: Daily
- Application code: On deployment
- Logs: Weekly archive

**Backup Verification:**
- Automated integrity checks: Daily
- Recovery testing: Monthly
- Cross-region replication: Weekly
- Documentation updates: Quarterly

**Recovery Procedures:**

**Database Recovery:**
```bash
# Stop application services
docker-compose stop searxng websocket-server

# Restore database from backup
docker-compose exec postgres pg_restore \
  --clean --if-exists \
  /backups/backup_2024-01-15.sql

# Restart services
docker-compose start searxng websocket-server

# Verify system health
./scripts/health-check.sh
```

**Complete System Recovery:**

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Week 0)**: Begin Phase 0 planning and team organization
2. **Short-term (Month 1)**: Complete infrastructure and core implementation
3. **Medium-term (Month 2)**: Deploy real-time features and launch
4. **Long-term (Month 3+)**: Enhance based on user feedback and scale

This roadmap represents a realistic, achievable path to creating something truly special—a search engine that brings friends closer together through shared discovery and intellectual companionship. The technical foundation will be solid, the user experience delightful, and the operational procedures robust enough to run reliably for years to come.

The vision of a "digital salon" where friends can explore knowledge together, celebrate serendipitous discoveries, and maintain warm connections through search is both ambitious and achievable with this comprehensive plan.
