# Searxng Convivial Instance Project

## Overview
A privacy-respecting search instance designed for 2-3 close friends, emphasizing conviviality and shared discovery over productivity.

### Key Differentiators

- **NOT** Spotify-based - fully independent music discovery
- **NOT** just another searxng - it's a shared experience

### Core Values
- Joy in discovery
- Intellectual companionship  
- Privacy with trust
- Serendipity over efficiency

### Technical Stack
- 4GB VPS with Docker Compose
- Redis for real-time features
