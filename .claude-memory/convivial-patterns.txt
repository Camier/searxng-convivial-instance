# Convivial Patterns in SearXNG Project

## Core Philosophy
The "convivial" concept centers around creating a warm, social search experience for small groups of friends (2-3 people). It's designed as a "digital salon" that emphasizes:
- Shared discovery over individual efficiency
- Intellectual companionship
- Privacy with trust
- Joy-driven design choices

## Key Convivial Features

### 1. Real-Time Presence & Awareness
- **Presence Bubbles**: Visual indicators showing when friends are online/searching
- **Search Activity**: Shows what friends are currently exploring (with privacy controls)
- **Ghost Mode**: Toggle for private/sensitive searches
- **Collision Detection**: Celebrates when friends search for the same things simultaneously
- **Ambient Awareness**: Gentle notifications rather than intrusive alerts

### 2. Social Discovery Features
- **Morning Coffee**: Daily digest of yesterday's collective discoveries
  - Coffee cup reactions (‚òï‚òï‚òï) instead of likes
  - AI-generated summaries of group discoveries
  - Theme extraction from search patterns
- **Discovery Feed**: Real-time stream of friend findings
- **Gift Wrapper**: Wrap discoveries as time-delayed gifts for friends
  - Customizable reveal times (1 hour to 1 week)
  - Different gift themes (classic, birthday, mystery, seasonal)
  - "Shake gift" feature for hints

### 3. Search Moods & Themes
Predefined search moods that adjust UI and boost relevant engines:
- üåô Late night rabbit hole
- üå∫ Sunday morning botanical  
- üçÑ Weird finds only
- üìö Serious research mode
- üéµ Vinyl digging simulation
- üó∫Ô∏è Historical adventures
- üî¨ Deep science dive
- üé™ Anything goes

### 4. Privacy Implementation
- **Trust-Based Model**: Small group (max 3 friends) with mutual trust
- **Selective Sharing**: Granular controls over what to share
- **Auto-Privacy**: Automatic privacy for medical/personal searches
- **"Unsee" Button**: Remove accidental shares
- **No Logs Policy**: Privacy-first approach
- **Anonymous Contributions**: Option to contribute without attribution

### 5. Technical Architecture
- **Backend**: SearXNG with custom Python plugins
- **Real-time**: WebSocket server (Node.js/Socket.io)
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL for user data, Redis for caching/pub-sub
- **Frontend**: Custom JavaScript with collaborative features
- **Deployment**: Docker-based, designed for small VPS (~$20-40/month)

## Unique Implementations

### Plugin System
Custom plugins extend SearXNG:
1. `convivial_presence.py`: Tracks friend activity and collisions
2. `morning_coffee.py`: Generates daily discovery digests
3. `gift_wrapper.py`: Time-delayed discovery sharing
4. `discovery_feed.py`: Real-time discovery stream
5. `search_moods.py`: Context-aware search themes

### WebSocket Integration
- Real-time presence updates
- Live search hints (anonymized)
- Instant collision celebrations
- Gift notifications
- Synchronized UI changes

### UI/UX Patterns
- Gentle animations (bob, pulse, fade)
- Warm color schemes per mood
- Tooltip-based information
- Non-intrusive notifications
- Organic visualization of collections

### Data Models
- Search sessions with mood tracking
- Discoveries with social metadata
- Time capsules for delayed sharing
- Collision events
- Coffee reactions

## Privacy-First Design
- No external tracking
- Local-first approach
- Encrypted friend connections
- Temporary data with TTLs
- Opt-in for all social features

## Cultural Elements
- French archives specialization
- Botanical/ethnopharmacology focus
- Independent music discovery
- Academic research tools
- Seasonal themes and rituals

This creates a unique blend of privacy-respecting search with intimate social features, designed for small groups who trust each other and want to explore the internet together.
