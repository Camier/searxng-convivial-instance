# SearXNG Convivial Instance - Security & Implementation Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This audit report provides a comprehensive review of the SearXNG Convivial Instance implementation, examining security configurations, service integrations, code quality, and deployment readiness. The project implements a social search engine with real-time collaboration features, including presence awareness, discovery sharing, and gift-wrapping functionality.

**Overall Assessment**: The implementation shows good architectural design with several innovative features, but requires critical security improvements and missing component implementations before production deployment.

## 1. Security Configurations & Vulnerabilities

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues

1. **Hardcoded Credentials**
   - PostgreSQL contains hardcoded default users in schema (`init-db/01-schema.sql`)
   - WebSocket server uses hardcoded JWT secret in development mode
   - Missing proper secret rotation mechanisms

2. **Missing Authentication System**
   - No actual authentication implementation found
   - WebSocket server accepts any token in development mode
   - Frontend assumes authenticated users without verification
   - No session management or user registration/login flows

3. **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**
   - Multiple raw SQL queries in plugins without proper parameterization
   - Example in `convivial_presence.py` lines 136-142 (cursor.execute with string formatting)
   - Potential for malicious input through search queries

4. **Missing Input Validation**
   - No validation on user inputs in WebSocket handlers
   - Frontend accepts unvalidated data from WebSocket events
   - Plugin data not sanitized before database storage

### ðŸŸ¡ Security Concerns

1. **SSL/TLS Configuration**
   - nginx.conf has good SSL settings but references non-existent certificates
   - Certbot integration present but no automation scripts
   - Missing HSTS headers

2. **CORS Configuration**
   - WebSocket server has permissive CORS settings
   - Should restrict origins in production

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Basic rate limiting in nginx (10r/s general, 30r/s search)
   - No rate limiting on WebSocket connections
   - Missing per-user rate limiting

4. **CSP Headers**
   - Content Security Policy too permissive (`'unsafe-inline'`)
   - Should implement stricter CSP rules

## 2. Service Configurations & Integrations

### âœ… Well-Configured Services

1. **Docker Composition**
   - Good service isolation with proper networking
   - Appropriate capability dropping (CAP_DROP: ALL)
   - Health checks implemented for PostgreSQL
   - Volume management for persistence

2. **Redis Architecture**
   - Separate instances for cache and pub/sub (good practice)
   - Proper port separation (6379 for cache, 6380 for pub/sub)

3. **Database Design**
   - Well-structured schema with proper relationships
   - UUID usage for primary keys
   - Comprehensive indexes for performance

### ðŸŸ¡ Configuration Issues

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Missing `.env` file or example
   - No documentation on required environment variables
   - Secrets referenced but not defined

2. **Service Dependencies**
   - WebSocket server starts before confirming database readiness
   - Missing retry logic for service connections

## 3. Missing Components & Incomplete Features

### ðŸ”´ Critical Missing Components

1. **Authentication Service**
   - No auth service in docker-compose
   - No JWT generation/validation implementation
   - No user registration/login endpoints

2. **File Storage Service**
   - Voice notes feature references S3 but no integration
   - No file upload handling implementation
   - Missing avatar/image storage solution

3. **Search Integration**
   - SearXNG settings.yml configured but plugins not properly integrated
   - Custom plugins not registered in enabled_plugins
   - Missing plugin initialization in SearXNG

4. **API Endpoints**
   - Frontend references `/api/morning-coffee` but no API implementation
   - Missing REST API layer between frontend and backend

### ðŸŸ¡ Incomplete Features

1. **Gift Wrapping System**
   - Database schema supports gifts but no reveal mechanism
   - Time capsule scheduling not implemented
   - Gift notification system incomplete

2. **Voice Notes**
   - Database schema exists but no upload/playback implementation
   - Transcription service not integrated

3. **Collection Management**
   - Database tables created but no CRUD operations
   - No UI for managing collections

## 4. Performance Considerations

### âœ… Good Practices

1. **Database Performance**
   - Proper indexes on frequently queried columns
   - Connection pooling in WebSocket server
   - Efficient query patterns in most places

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Redis cache properly configured
   - TTL settings on cached data
   - Separation of cache and pub/sub

### ðŸŸ¡ Performance Issues

1. **Memory Leaks**
   - WebSocket server doesn't clean up event listeners
   - Potential memory leak in `asyncio.create_task` without proper cleanup
   - Frontend MutationObserver never disconnects

2. **Blocking Operations**
   - Synchronous database calls in async context (plugins)
   - OpenAI API calls block event loop in morning_coffee.py

3. **Resource Limits**
   - No connection limits on PostgreSQL pool
   - WebSocket server allows unlimited connections per user
   - Missing backpressure handling

## 5. Code Quality & Best Practices

### âœ… Good Practices

1. **Code Organization**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Modular plugin architecture
   - Consistent file structure

2. **Error Handling**
   - Try-catch blocks in most critical paths
   - Logging implemented throughout
   - Graceful degradation in frontend

### ðŸ”´ Code Quality Issues

1. **Python Code Issues**
   - Using deprecated `asyncio.create_task` without proper task management
   - Mixing sync and async code inappropriately
   - Global variables for connection management (not thread-safe)

2. **JavaScript Issues**
   - No TypeScript for type safety
   - Global namespace pollution (`window.ConvivialFeatures`)
   - Inline event handlers in generated HTML
   - No proper state management

3. **Security Anti-patterns**
   - String concatenation for SQL queries
   - Direct HTML injection without escaping
   - Storing sensitive data in sessionStorage

## 6. Deployment Readiness

## Conclusion

The SearXNG Convivial Instance shows innovative design with unique social search features. However, it requires significant work before production deployment. The most critical issues are the missing authentication system, SQL injection vulnerabilities, and incomplete core features. 

With proper implementation of security measures, completion of missing components, and adherence to production best practices, this could become a compelling social search platform. The architecture is sound, but execution needs refinement.

**Recommended Timeline**:
- Week 1-2: Implement authentication and fix security vulnerabilities
- Week 3-4: Complete missing core features and API implementation
- Week 5-6: Production preparation and testing
- Week 7-8: Performance optimization and monitoring setup

**Risk Assessment**: HIGH - Do not deploy to production without addressing critical security issues and implementing authentication.
